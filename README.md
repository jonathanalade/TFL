### TFL

Version 1.0

Introduction
This ReadME is a brief summary of the Automation Framework created for TFL.gov.uk and the key Test Cases that have been scripted. 
The framework created shows the 5 Test Cases and the Methods taken to compile these test cases with the results within the Framework to view.

Automation Tester Coding Challenge

Technologies
- Install Microsoft Visual Studio
- SpecFlow
- The required NuGetPackages i.e. SeleniumWebDriver &  SeleniumChromeDriver

Development Decisions
- For simplicity, I chose not to create too many new elements on the Element Page
- NUnit.Framework & TechTalk.SpecFlow were imperative to following the Instructions and using the SpecFlow system to create the test cases.
